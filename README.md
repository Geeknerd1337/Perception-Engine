# What is the Perception Engine?
Perception Engine is an all in one framework for making games in Unity. It is intended to remove a lot of the boiler plate involved in creating a lot of Unity projects. This includes things like debugging, AI, controllers, and basically anything you would need for your standard game engine. The behavior is intended to be abstract and easily extendable for use in my personal projects, but I am making it available to the public so that they can benefit as well.
